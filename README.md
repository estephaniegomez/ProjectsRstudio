Data Analysis Projects – Python & R

This repository contains small data analysis projects developed using Python, R, and their integration.

The purpose of this repository is to explore different analytical workflows and demonstrate interoperability between both tools.


Project Structure
🔹 analisis1/

A data analysis project developed entirely in Python.

It includes:

Data cleaning

Exploratory data analysis (EDA)

Feature engineering

Basic statistical summaries and visualizations

🔹 Python_to_R/

A project that tests the integration between Python and R.

It demonstrates:

Passing data from Python to R

Using rpy2 for interoperability

Generating visualizations in R from a Python environment

Saving outputs and rendering them dynamically

This project highlights how both tools can complement each other within a single workflow.

Objective

The goal of this repository is to:

- Practice reproducible data analysis

- Compare Python and R analytical workflows

Explore cross-language integration in real scenarios

Technologies Used

- Python (pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn)
- R (ggplot2, sf, rnaturalearth)
- rpy2
- Jupyter Notebook

🚀 Reproducibility

To run the projects locally:

Clone the repository

Install the required Python and R dependencies

Open the notebooks and run all cells

✨ This repository will continue to grow with additional analysis projects.
