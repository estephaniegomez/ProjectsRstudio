# Python & R: Complementary Strengths in Data Science

This project aims to demonstrate a classification analysis in Python combined with advanced visualization in R.

Rather than positioning both tools as competitors, this work highlights how they complement each other within a data science workflow.

Python is used for:
- Data engineering and preprocessing
- Feature preparation
- Model training and evaluation

R is used for:
- Statistical visualization
- Geospatial representation
- Elegant graphical communication of insights

*Dedication*

This project is dedicated to a former colleague, Jimena Murillo.

She is a pure statistician focused on data science; I am a hybrid data scientist/engineer. While working together, I deeply admired her statistical reasoning and analytical rigor. In parallel, my role focused on data engineering, cleaning, structuring, and enabling data so that strong statistical analysis could take place. This project is a humble attempt to honor that collaboration. It reflects a fundamental lesson: Great statistical analysis shines when supported by solid data engineering. And great data science thrives when statistical thinking guides it.

Different tools, Different strengths, One shared objective: meaningful insight.

*Disclaimer* R is fully capable of performing data cleaning, feature engineering, and classification modeling. Likewise, Python also provides strong visualization and statistical capabilities. This project does not imply technical superiority of one tool over the other. Instead, it intentionally assigns:

- Python to data engineering and classification tasks

- R to statistical and geospatial visualization

The goal is to illustrate how both tools can complement each other within a unified analytical workflow.

*Dataset*

Kaggle dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tushardobal/india-city-air-quality-index-dataset-20152023


*Interactive Map Note*

The interactive AQI map (with the year slider) is rendered using ipywidgets and R integration inside Python.

GitHub does not execute interactive notebook components. For this reason, the slider may not display properly in the online preview.

To view the interactive map locally:

- Clone or download this repository

- Ensure you have:

- Python installed

- R installed

- Required Python packages (rpy2, ipywidgets, pandas, etc.)

- Required R packages (ggplot2, sf, rnaturalearth, etc.)

- Open the notebook and run all cells, make sure paths match your local folder structure if needed, In this repo there is png image you can refer to check that everything executed smoothly.
